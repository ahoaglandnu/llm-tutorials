# Tutorial: Quantizing Large Language Models

## Introduction

Briefly explain what this tutorial is about, the importance of quantizing large language models, and what quantization is.

Quantization is a technique that reduces the precision of the model's numerical representations, typically from 32-bit floating-point to lower precision formats like 16-bit, 8-bit, or even 4-bit. 

Quantization significantly reduces the storage requirements of these models. Lower precision calculations are faster and more energy-efficient. 

The primary concern is the trade-off between model size and performance. Reducing numerical precision can lead to a loss in the model's ability to perform tasks accurately.
