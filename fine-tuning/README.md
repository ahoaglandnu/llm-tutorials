# Fine-tuning Large Language Models using LoRA and QLoRA Techniques

## Introduction

Briefly explain what this tutorial is about, the importance of fine-tuning large language models, and what the techniques are.

LoRA is a technique that allows for the efficient fine-tuning of large pre-trained models. It introduces trainable low-rank matrices into the model's architecture, which modify existing weight matrices. This approach significantly reduces the number of trainable parameters, enabling faster and more resource-efficient fine-tuning without substantial loss in performance.

QLoRA incorporates quantization into the adaptation process. Quantization reduces the precision of numerical representations, further decreasing the model's memory footprint and computational demand. QLoRA uniquely combines the benefits of low-rank adaptations with quantization, making it a powerful tool for deploying large models in resource-constrained environments.

Direct Preference Optimization is a technique that prioritizes human preferences in the training process of language models. It's a strategic approach that adjusts the model's learning to be more in tune with what humans find relevant and valuable.
