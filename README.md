# Large Language Model Enhancements: Fine-Tuning, Quantization, and RAG

This repository contains practical demos and tutorials for three advanced techniques in natural language processing: Fine-Tuning Large Language Models, Quantization, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). Each demo provides a hands-on example to showcase the effectiveness and implementation of these techniques.

## Overview
The field of natural language processing is rapidly evolving, with new methodologies enhancing the capabilities of language models. This repository focuses on three key areas:

- **Fine-Tuning**: Demonstrating how to fine-tune large pre-trained language models for specific tasks or datasets.
- **Quantization**: Exploring techniques to reduce model size and computational demands while maintaining performance.
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**: Showcasing how to enrich model responses with external knowledge sources.
