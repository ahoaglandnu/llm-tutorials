# Tutorial: Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)

## Introduction

Retrieval-Augmented Generation is a technique that integrates traditional language models with external knowledge sources. It operates by first retrieving relevant information from a dataset or knowledge base and then using this information to guide the text generation process.

Traditional language models are limited by the knowledge they acquired during training. RAG allows these models to access and leverage external, up-to-date information, broadening their scope and relevance. By retrieving information relevant to the given context, RAG-enhanced models can generate more accurate and contextually appropriate responses, especially for questions requiring factual correctness.
